Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions ("classe" variable): 
1. exactly according to the specification (Class A)
2. throwing the elbows to the front (Class B)
3. lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C)
4. lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D)
5. throwing the hips to the front (Class E)

The data was collected from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell to predict the manner in which they performed their fitness exercise. The data consists of a training set and a test set and includes 159 features and one predictor ("classe" variable as decribed above).

This report describes how I built a Random Forest model to predict the 20 different test cases.
