## Description of the project

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

### Data

The data comes in the form of a comma-separated-value file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm. It is located in the "Data" folder. The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. 

The dataset includes a total of 37 variables and 902,297 entries. 

Complete documentation for the data can be found

The purpose of this project is to address the following questions: 

1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?

2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

Detailed steps are presented in the
