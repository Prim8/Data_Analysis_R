# Question 5
# How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008
# in Baltimore City?
# Note: an inspection of the data source documentation (http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/net/2008neiv3/2008_neiv3_tsd_draft.pdf)
# indicates that of the four types of sources inticated by the "type"
# column, vehicles are classified under the "on-road" type. Therefore, 
# I will use a subset of "on-road" type for Baltimore to answer to this
# question.
